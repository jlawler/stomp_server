In addition to the TODO's I've added inline, the following things also need to be addressed:
  * Use log4r (or something) to do logging.  I need to migrate off of "puts" asap.
  * the @pending var in queue_manager is a hash (key connection, value frames) that stores what messages
    the connection still hasn't ACKed.  Rename this, and expand it so we can actually do transactions.
  * 
  * Because of the way the internal algs work, we only have to pull messages out of the 
    per-connection-queue on ACK.  The only way it could have an element in it's per-connection-queue is 
    because someone tried to write to it, but it had a message pending.
    


Note:  The general algorithm is this:
  when someone sends a message:
    Can someone accept it?  If so, send it to them.
    else: queue it up.

  when someone acks a message:
    Do we have any pending messages?  If so, send it to them.


Notes for adding configurable broadcast + monitoring queues:
Create config yaml a la:
seperator: '.'
queues:
  monitor: topic.monitor
  broadcast: topic.monitor
queues:
  monitor: 
    topic.monitor: topic.foo> 
  broadcast: 
    - topic.*.foo
    - topic.bar.>
 queues:
  monitor: 
    topic.monitor: topic.foo> 
  broadcast:  #This broadcast syntax is because I might come up with config options
    'topic.*.foo': true
    'topic.bar.>': true


You can get a message queue when: 
  when a different party calls sendmsg
  when you ack <- not sure how to choose which is next message, broadcastqueue, or qstore
  when you subscribe <- doesn't affect us, unless we allow "presubscribed" users, which we don't
